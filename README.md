Hello GitHub community! My name is Ray, and I am a Data Analyst at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I currently work on processign and visualizing West Coast commerical fishing data to understand how fishing economies are responding to federal regulation.Previously, I worked with the [Northwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center) at NOAA to model salmon habitat restoration costs in the Puget Sound of Washington state. I also worked as a research lead with [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/) to study invasive species responses to endemic Channel Islands predators to strengthen island biosecurity protocols. I mostly work in R running statistical and machine learning models, geospatial analysis, and Shiny app development. I enjoy surfing, rock climbing, yoga, and spearfishing in my free time. Send me an email or LinkedIn invite if you want to connect!
